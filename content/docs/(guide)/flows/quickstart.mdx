title: Quickstart
description: This guide will walk you through creating and running your first Zelo Flow in minutes.
---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have Zelo CLI installed and configured. You should be able to run `zelo` commands from your terminal.

## Creating Your First Flow

Generate a new flow using the CLI:

```bash
zelo flows new code-review
```

This creates a complete flow structure in `./.zelo/flows/code-review/` with:

- A working flow configuration
- Example agents
- Sample nodes
- Prompt templates
- Comprehensive README

## Understanding the Generated Flow

Let's examine what was created:

### Flow Configuration

Open `.zelo/flows/code-review/flow.yaml`:

```yaml
specVersion: "1.0.0"

id: code-review
name: "code-review"
version: "0.1.0"
description: "A Zelo Flow."

entry: main

inputs:
  repoPath:
    type: string
    prompt: "Repository path"
  strict:
    type: boolean
    prompt: "Enable strict mode?"

exports:
  defaultNode: review.node

graph:
  main:
    type: graph
    nodes:
      - id: review
        nodeRef: review.node
      - id: summary
        nodeRef: summary.node
    edges:
      - from: review
        to: summary
```

This defines:
- Two input parameters that will be collected interactively
- A graph with two sequential nodes
- An entry point named `main`

### Agents

The flow includes two agents in the `agents/` directory:

**Base Agent** (`agents/base.reviewer.md`):

```markdown
---
kind: Agent
name: base.reviewer
abstract: true
constraints:
  temperature: 0.2
---

You are a senior software engineer.
Give concrete, actionable feedback.
```

**Strict Agent** (`agents/strict.reviewer.md`):

```markdown
---
kind: Agent
name: strict.reviewer
extends: base.reviewer
constraints:
  temperature: 0.1
---

{{ super }}

Be strict. Flag ambiguity and risky changes.
```

The strict agent inherits from the base agent and adds additional instructions.

### Nodes

Two nodes are defined in the `nodes/` directory:

**Review Node** (`nodes/review.node.md`):

```markdown
---
kind: Node
name: review.node
agentRef: strict.reviewer
prompt: prompts/review.md
inputSchema:
  type: object
  properties:
    repoPath: { type: string }
    strict: { type: boolean }
  required: [repoPath]
---

Review the repository at {{inputs.repoPath}}.
Strict mode: {{inputs.strict}}.
```

This node uses the strict reviewer agent and references a prompt file.

**Summary Node** (`nodes/summary.node.md`):

```markdown
---
kind: Node
name: summary.node
agentRef: strict.reviewer
prompt: prompts/summary.md
inputSchema:
  type: object
  properties:
    repoPath: { type: string }
    strict: { type: boolean }
  required: [repoPath]
---

Summarize findings for {{inputs.repoPath}}.
```

### Prompts

Prompt files in `prompts/` contain the task instructions:

**Review Prompt** (`prompts/review.md`):

```markdown
Inspect the repository and produce a structured review:
- correctness
- security
- maintainability

Use Zelo's normal coding tools and context.
```

## Running the Flow

Execute your flow with:

```bash
zelo flows run code-review
```

Or without specifying the ID to select from available flows:

```bash
zelo flows run
```

The CLI will prompt you for inputs:

```
Repository path: ./src
Enable strict mode? Yes
```

Zelo will then execute the review node followed by the summary node, displaying results as they complete.

## Using from Within Zelo

You can also run flows from within a Zelo session:

```
/run-flow code-review
```

This provides the same interactive experience and execution behavior.

## Customizing the Flow

Now that you have a working flow, try customizing it:

### Modify Agent Behavior

Edit `agents/strict.reviewer.md` to adjust the review style:

```markdown
---
kind: Agent
name: strict.reviewer
extends: base.reviewer
constraints:
  temperature: 0.1
---

{{ super }}

Focus on security vulnerabilities and performance issues.
Use a formal, technical tone.
```

### Add New Inputs

Update `flow.yaml` to add a new input parameter:

```yaml
inputs:
  repoPath:
    type: string
    prompt: "Repository path"
  strict:
    type: boolean
    prompt: "Enable strict mode?"
  focusArea:
    type: select
    prompt: "Focus area"
    options:
      - security
      - performance
      - maintainability
```

Then reference it in your nodes:

```markdown
Focus on {{inputs.focusArea}} aspects.
```

### Extend with New Nodes

Create a new node in `nodes/detailed-analysis.node.md`:

```markdown
---
kind: Node
name: detailed-analysis.node
agentRef: strict.reviewer
prompt: prompts/detailed-analysis.md
inputSchema:
  type: object
  properties:
    repoPath: { type: string }
  required: [repoPath]
---

Perform detailed analysis on {{inputs.repoPath}}.
```

Add it to the flow graph:

```yaml
graph:
  main:
    type: graph
    nodes:
      - id: review
        nodeRef: review.node
      - id: analysis
        nodeRef: detailed-analysis.node
      - id: summary
        nodeRef: summary.node
    edges:
      - from: review
        to: analysis
      - from: analysis
        to: summary
```
